[The video that goes over how I made this](https://youtu.be/4dx3xqoDRgQ)


This Desmos Renderer is based heavily on [Junferno's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQvBq3K50u8). However, you can run this one directly in your webbrowser

*also the lines in the final version will jitter between colors (i think its pretty)*

The performance isn't fantastic, it takes a few minutes (like up to 30 minutes if larger video) to download stuff and run a bunch of convertions, then it renders the frames at approximately 10-25 seconds per frame

Sample results:

Go open the Jupyter Notebook in colab, I put everything on there.
